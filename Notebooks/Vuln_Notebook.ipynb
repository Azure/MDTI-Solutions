When TOR hidden services are installed on a device, the device becomes a TOR network server with a unique\\u00a0*.onion*\\u00a0domain that the attacker can connect to using the domain and a pre-configured port number, in this case port 3389, redirecting the attacker\\u2019s malicious traffic to the device\\u2019s Remote Desktop Protocol service on the local system.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Timeline\\r\\n\\r\\nThis behavior was identified as early as September 2020, continuing sporadically throughout the last few months of 2020, 2021, and 2022, with the latest example occurring in early November 2022, as of the time of this report.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](https://cdn-riq-ti.azureedge.net/iridium-timeline.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n*IRIDIUM TOR hidden service attack diagram*\\r\\n\\r\\n## Attack chain\\r\\n\\r\\nThis activity is referred to as\\u00a0*ShadowLink*\\u00a0which establishes persistence through TOR at a late stage of compromise. IRIDIUM is known to use a variety of means to compromise a target network.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Upon accessing the target network, several methods have been identified to create the TOR installation software package on a device. The TOR installation software package is included in a self-extracting RAR archive (SFX), often named\\u00a0*defender.exe.*\\u00a0These SFXs might be introduced to a target network in a variety of ways but have been historically retrieved through actor-controlled URLs from commodity file-sharing websites such as\\u00a0*anonfiles.com*. Other instances of SFXs \\u00a0indicate distribution following infections of DarkCrystal RAT\\u2014a remote access tool often used by IRIDIUM.\\r\\n- Typically using PowerShell, the attacker installs a service on the device using the newly downloaded RAR archive. This sets up the TOR hidden service on the device and configures its parameters. The service is named Tor Win32 Service.\\r\\n- Example command line artifacts of installation procedures lend well to behavioral detection of ShadowLink:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Defender\\\\defender.exe\\\" --service install -options -f C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Data\\\\Defender\\\\def\\r\\n- The installation package contains a configuration file that sets the TOR service up on port 3389. This configuration forwards connections to the\\u00a0*.onion*\\u00a0url associated with the target device to port 3389 on the local host. An attacker can essentially connect to the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) through an external device, bypassing network boundary protections and providing the attacker with an additional method of entering the network, if their access gets removed. To determine a fruitful compromise, the attacker can then verify whether the TOR service installation succeeded and check the onion URL to confirm redirection to the target device\\u2019s login screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above activity, referred to as\\u00a0*ShadowLink,*\\u00a0can be paired with a secondary element, allowing IRIDIUM to achieve command execution in an unauthenticated environment. Historical deployments of\\u00a0*ShadowLink*\\u00a0indicate that IRIDIUM has often paired command execution persistence mechanisms such as Sticky Keys and Accessibility Feature by replacing the legitimate services (such as the Magnify service\\u2014*magnify.exe*) with the command prompt binary (cmd.exe). When IRIDIUM pairs these configurations with access facilitated by\\u00a0*ShadowLink*, the group can achieve command execution on an impacted system without user-level authentication.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Behaviors and methodologies\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon launch, the self-extracting RAR archive silently creates the following folders and files in the C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\_ directory:\\r\\n\\r\\n| File or folder | Name of file or folder |\\r\\n| --- | --- |\\r\\n| Folder | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender |\\r\\n| Folder | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Data |\\r\\n| Folder | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Data\\\\Defender |\\r\\n| File (TOR config file) | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Data\\\\Defender\\\\def |\\r\\n| File | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Data\\\\Defender\\\\geoip |\\r\\n| File | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Data\\\\Defender\\\\geoip6 |\\r\\n| Folder | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Defender |\\r\\n| File (TOR installer) | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Defender\\\\defender.exe |\\r\\n| File | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Defender\\\\libcrypto-1\\\\_1.dll |\\r\\n| File | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Defender\\\\libevent-2-1-7.dll |\\r\\n| File | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Defender\\\\libevent\\\\_core-2-1-7.dll |\\r\\n| File | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Defender\\\\libevent\\\\_extra-2-1-7.dll |\\r\\n| File | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Defender\\\\libgcc\\\\_s\\\\_sjlj-1.dll |\\r\\n| File | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Defender\\\\libssl-1\\\\_1.dll |\\r\\n| File | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Defender\\\\libssp-0.dll |\\r\\n| File | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Defender\\\\libwinpthread-1.dll |\\r\\n| File | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Defender\\\\PluggableTransports |\\r\\n| File | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Defender\\\\PluggableTransports/obfs4proxy.exe |\\r\\n| File | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Defender\\\\tor-gencert.exe |\\r\\n| File | C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Defender\\\\Defender\\\\zlib1.dll |  |\\r\\n\\r\\nThe files listed in the table above are highly prevalent yet not inherently malicious (easily found on VirusTotal) except for the\\u00a0*Defender/Data/Defender/def*\\u00a0file.\\u00a0*Def*\\u00a0is a unique TOR config file specific to this capability. The config file contains two noteworthy configuration criteria\\u2014parameters for the\\u00a0*obfs4proxy*\\u00a0plugin and parameters for which port to run the TOR service on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe\\u00a0*obfs4proxy*\\u00a0plugin is an\\u00a0[open-source project](https://github.com/Yawning/obfs4)\\u00a0called obfs4 that specializes in the obfuscation of transport data, primarily written for the purposes of obfuscating TOR traffic, allowing the technique and thus the attacker to remain undetected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe TOR service operates on port 3389, meaning any traffic that reaches the device over the TOR network gets redirected to port 3389, also known as the RDP port. An attacker can browse the TOR-accessible\\u00a0*.onion*\\u00a0URL on their own device and automatically connect to the Remote Desktop Protocol where they can log in to the device through RDP. This bypasses any firewall rules that deny external access to RDP, as TOR relies on outbound access from both the server and the client to connect.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter both replacing the legitimate\\u00a0*magnify.exe*\\u00a0with\\u00a0*cmd.exe*\\u00a0and creating an RDP backdoor using the TOR network, the attacker can RDP into a device from outside the network regardless of firewall protections and gain device SYSTEM level access,\\u00a0*even if the credentials the attacker had previously used for compromising the device have been changed*. The attacker can also add new accounts and regain device access, as long as the TOR service is running and the accessibility feature is exploited.\\r\\n## Recommendations\\r\\nApply these mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat. Check the recommendations card for the deployment status of monitored mitigations. This attack technique depends on whether the attacker can already access the environment. Secure your environment and employ the principle of least privilege to mitigate this threat. Read the\\u00a0[Microsoft Security Best Practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/security/compass/compass?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc)\\u00a0for details. Other general recommendations are included below:\\r\\n\\r\\n- [Turn on Microsoft Defender Antivirus.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configuration-management-reference-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide)\\r\\n- Enable\\u00a0[network protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-network-protection?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc).\\r\\n- Enable\\u00a0[Network Level Authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc753488%28v=ws.11%29?redirectedfrom=MSDN). This assists in preventing the Accessibility Features (magnify.exe) exploitation. Network Level Authentication requires that a user authenticate prior to viewing the login screen of a Remote Desktop connection. This does not assist in mitigating a connection to the device via TOR if the attacker still has the credentials to the device from the previous compromise.\\r\\n- Enable Microsoft Defender Antivirus scanning of downloaded files and attachments.\\r\\n- [Enable Microsoft Defender Antivirus real-time behavior monitoring.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-real-time-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide)\\r\\n- [Enable Apply UAC restrictions to local accounts on network logons.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/user-account-control-and-remote-restriction)\\r\\n- Enable\\u00a0[EDR in block mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/edr-in-block-mode?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc).\\r\\n- Enable\\u00a0[multi-factor authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-how-it-works?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc).\\r\\n- [Reduce lateral movement path risk to sensitive entities.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/understand-lateral-movement-paths)\\r\\n- [Stop legacy protocols communication.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/security-assessment-legacy-protocols)\\r\\n- [Stop clear text credentials exposure.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/security-assessment-clear-text)\\r\\n\\r\\nTurn on the following\\u00a0[attack surface reduction rule](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/attack-surface-reduction?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc)s\\u00a0to block or audit activity associated with this threat:\\r\\n\\r\\n- [Block credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc#block-credential-stealing-from-the-windows-local-security-authority-subsystem)\\r\\n- [Block executables from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc#block-executable-files-from-running-unless-they-meet-a-prevalence-age-or-trusted-list-criterion)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Assess rule impact before deployment\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can assess how an attack surface reduction rule might impact your network by opening the\\u00a0[security recommendation](https://securitycenter.windows.com/security-recommendations?ocid=magicti_ta_tvmsecreco)\\u00a0for that rule in threat and vulnerability management.

      "        \"content\": \"ACTINIUM primarily uses spear phishing emails to infect targets. These emails harness remote template injection to load malicious code or content. Typically, this content will involve a malicious macro that contains a VBScript which loads further capabilities, such as scripts or malware, to gain access to a target device. Delivery using remote template injection ensures that malicious content only loads when required, such as when the user opens the document. This tactic assists attackers in evading static detections from systems that scan attachments for malicious content. Hosting the macro remotely also allows an attacker to control when and how the malicious component is delivered, further evading detection by preventing automated systems from obtaining and analyzing the malicious component. ACTINIUM operators often attach a self-executing archive with SFX or RAR files containing obfuscated scripts to a spear phishing email. These scripts are coded to download further malicious payloads or drop and invoke remote access tools that allow ACTINIUM direct interaction with the target device.  Microsoft security researchers have observed the group use a range of email phishing lures, including those that impersonate and masquerade as legitimate organizations, with benign attachments to establish trust and familiarity with the target, as shown below.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](https://cdn-riq-ti.azureedge.net/90f89e36-a0f7-450b-a3cd-89694a80b991)  \\r\\n\\r\\nACTINIUM has inserted web bugs within the body of a phishing message. Web bugs are small external image references that enable the actor to track when a message has been opened and rendered. While not malicious themselves, web bugs might indicate that the email is intended for malicious use, as shown below.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](https://cdn-riq-ti.azureedge.net/b14001e1-b039-464b-bf66-27c227a2fc57)  \\r\\n\\r\\nACTINIUM\\u2019s lure documents appear legitimate and vary in style and content. For example, the lure document shown below includes a remote template.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](https://cdn-riq-ti.azureedge.net/0722a670-fcd4-4433-af26-42e8e840829d)  \\r\\n\\r\\n![](https://cdn-riq-ti.azureedge.net/9bdf675a-574b-4ab8-808c-4f03b5a24e80)  \\r\\n\\r\\nACTINIUM phishing attachments contain a first-stage payload that downloads and executes further payloads, at which point multiple subsequent \\u201cstaging\\u201d scripts might follow before a more fully featured malicious capability deploys to a compromised device. While the reason behind the multiple stages remains unclear, one hypothesis is that these staging VBScripts are easier to modify to incorporate new obfuscation or command-and-control (C2) changes. ACTINIUM might deploy these scripts to help prevent detection systems from detecting its main capabilities. These initial staging capabilities vary, with examples including heavily obfuscated VBScripts, obfuscated PowerShell commands, self-extracting archives, *.Lnk* files, or a combination of these.\\r\\n\\r\\nACTINIUM most often relies on scheduled tasks in the group\\u2019s scripts to maintain persistence.

ACTINIUM\\u2019s operational infrastructure consists of many domains and hosts to facilitate payload staging and command-and-control (C2). In a single 30-day snapshot, ACTINIUM utilized over 25 new unique domains and over 80 unique IP addresses, demonstrating that the group frequently modifies or alters its infrastructure.\\r\\n\\r\\nACTINIUM domain name DNS records frequently change and, while perhaps not frequently enough to be considered \\u201cfast-flux,\\u201d most DNS records for the domains change once a day on average. More than 70% of the recent 200-plus ACTINIUM IP addresses are owned by *ASN 197695\\u2013Reg.ru*. The majority of the group\\u2019s domains are also registered through the same owning company registrar (*Reg.ru*). ACTINIUM\\u2019s reasoning for favoring these legitimate providers remains unclear.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen invoked, the group\\u2019s downloader VBScripts flush the DNS cache of the target device and resolve the target domain. The scripts use the resolving IP address to invoke a HTTP request to the IP address hosting the group\\u2019s C2 infrastructure. This request allows the group to maintain a rapidly moving C2 infrastructure for its various target devices.\\r\\n\\r\\nMalware authored by ACTINIUM often utilizes randomized subdomains for C2 and the actor likely uses some form of domain generation algorithm (DGA). These generated domains have included the use of what is likely to be a static English wordlist in the group\\u2019s generation procedure, making the domains appear more legitimate, while frustrating network defense tools that might rely on domain name blocks. In another observation, ACTINIUM used hardcoded IP addresses rather than domains in some of its scripts, likely to evade detection.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the build-up to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, to aid defenders and multiple vendors, Microsoft publicly released information on ACTINIUM that described how to identify the group\\u2019s infrastructure. Although a strong shift in TTPs has not been observed since this publication, this public disclosure might lead the group to change its tactics, techniques, or procedures.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Malware\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presence of the following malware and hacking tools can indicate an active breach being perpetrated by this group.
